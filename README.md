## 🧠 Final Project – Divercité

**Divercité** is a decision-making game where an AI agent selects the best move in a simplified strategic board setting, balancing diversity and efficiency. The agent was developed using various AI search and optimization techniques including:

- Constraint satisfaction (Minizinc)
- Local search (Hill climbing, Simulated Annealing)
- Genetic algorithms
- Heuristic analysis

### 🧪 Features

- Multiple heuristic strategies tested and compared  
- Implementation of stochastic and deterministic agents  
- Evaluation based on diversity gain and time efficiency

### 📄 Documentation

Detailed explanations of the algorithms, heuristics, and results can be found in the `Projet_Divercite_A2024/` folder.
